# `wipdev`'s Neovim Configuration

The basis for this config was
[Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which is a sensible
setup for package management, LSP, completion, etc. I don't sync my config with
it - just took it as a starting point and started hacking. I have no planning
of doing such sync later because I refactored the code to span more than one
file (and configure each plugin in its own file, more or less).

To add to a vanilla Neovim installation, you should clone the code this repo in
`~/.config/nvim`
