# `wipdev`'s Neovim Configuration

The basis for this config was [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which is a sensible
setup for package management, LSP, completion, etc. I don't sync my config
with it - just took it as a starting point and started hacking. I may (not) do
the sync later.

To add to a vanilla Neovim installation, you should clone the code this repo in `~/.config/nvim`
